// Escape (fanout) planning, version 1 (roadmap M9; design doc 05 §3).
//
// Dense packages (QFP/TSOP/SOIC rows, BGA/LGA arrays) fail in the router's strict first pass when other nets'
// routes take the channels a pin needs to leave its package: the pin is then "boxed in" until negotiation,
// which large boards often do not reach within the budget. The plan reserves, for every pin that has to be
// routed, a short escape corridor: straight out of the package for pins on its perimeter, and a dog-bone stub to
// the diagonal interstitial via site for the inner balls of an SMD array (the classic BGA fanout; Yan & Wong,
// "Recent research development in PCB layout", ICCAD 2010, §3; Kong, Yan & Wong, "Optimal simultaneous pin
// assignment and escape routing for dense PCBs", ASP-DAC 2010, for the escape model). The router treats
// another net's corridor as blocked in strict passes and as costly in negotiated passes, and releases a corridor
// once its pin is connected. Reservations only remove options: every commit is still checked exactly, so the
// plan cannot introduce violations.
