# Broken-board DRC parity regression: defects injected deterministically into the boards listed in
# drc_broken_boards.txt (shorts, crossings, dangling tracks and vias, cut connections; see
# `tracemaker selftest-defects`) must be classified exactly like kicad-cli does, violation by violation.
# Two seeds, 12 defect kinds, 3 defects each. Needs kicad-cli (Docker image); skips otherwise. KiCad results are
# cached by file content in build/drc/kicad, so only the first run calls kicad-cli (at most 2 containers at once).
# Usage: drc_broken_parity.sh [TRACEMAKER_BINARY] (default: build/release, scripts/drc_broken_parity.py).
